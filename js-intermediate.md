  Researched answer: Destructuring assignment is a special syntax that allows us to “unpack” arrays or objects into a bunch of variables, as sometimes that's more convenient. Destructuring also works great with complex functions that have a lot of parameters, default values, and so on.



3. Why is testing important?

  Your answer:Helps test UI errors such as bugs. Helps determine if your code works overall and not by just console.logging that certain line.

  Researched answer:Testing is important aspect for any project despite it being a web or mobile based application. Javascript testing helps to identify bugs during the development phase and fixing those bugs before the release helps users to get a reliable product.

5. What did you learn during the group project this week? Please include any additional feedback you may have.

  Your answer:People in your group may not have the same approach to the solution or way to tackle a task and that can be frustrating. After trying out their way and learing why it does or doesnt work is actually beneficial to you in the long run, regardless if it wasnt the way you wanted to do it. Also React is primarily used for bragging rights.



### HTML/CSS Review questions: First, try to answer each question on your own then Google the answer to further your knowledge.

1. How do you link a CSS file to your HTML page?

  Your answer:import /.App.css at the top of your html page

  Researched answer:The external Style Sheet (.css file) always seperate from HTML file. You can link this external file (.css file) to your HTML document file using the < link > tag . You can place this < link > tag Within the < head > section, and after the < title > element of your HTML file.


2. What is the difference between a div and a span?

  Your answer: im not entirely sure what a span is. but a div is a line-break used to group code.

  Researched answer:The span tag is used with inline elements whilst the div tag is used with block-level content.


3. What is a CSS class? When should you use an id instead of a class?

  Your answer:You call on your defined class to style it in your css component by using period "classname". You would use Id when you only want your css to apply to 1 variable because ID is for a certain variable while class can be used more than once.

  Researched answer: The .class selector selects elements with a specific class attribute. To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the name of the class. You can also specify that only specific HTML elements should be affected by a class.
  
  A class can be used several times, while an ID can only be used once, so you should use classes for items that you know you're going to use a lot.

  Researched answer: <header>, <p>, <footer>, <section>, <article>

### Stretch: The following questions are potential interview questions. First, try to answer each question on your own then Google the answer to further your knowledge.

1. What is front end development? Can you identify any tools/skills that are uniquely required of front end developers?

  Your answer:front end development has to do with the user interface part of coding. That could have to do with what the user see's when turning on their Monitor.

  Researched answer: Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly.


2. What is block scope in JavaScript?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer: A block scope is the area within if, switch conditions or for and while loops. Generally speaking, whenever you see {curly brackets}, it is a block. In ES6, const and let keywords allow developers to declare variables in the block scope, which means those variables exist only within the corresponding block.


3. How would you explain the idea of "inheritance" in object oriented programming?

  Your answer: When working in React or JavaScript you have child/dumb components that will be passed down or will inherit traits from the Parent/Smart component (like a family tree).

  Researched answer:Inheritance is a mechanism in which one class acquires the property of another class. For example, a child inherits the traits of his/her parents. With inheritance, we can reuse the fields and methods of the existing class. Hence, inheritance facilitates Reusability and is an important concept of OOPs.
